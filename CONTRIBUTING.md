# How to contribute

First of all, thanks for reading this doc!

Open a new issue with **Request new bank** template, fill the informations of the bank in the issue. The template already asks for all needed information.

If you wish, fork the repository, make changes to all files (csv, sql, xml and json) and change readme files with a changelog (stating their name and issue code)
