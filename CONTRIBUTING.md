# How to contribute

First of all, thanks for reading this doc!

Open a new issue with **Request new bank** template, fill the information of the bank in the issue.
The template already asks for all needed information.

If you want to remove a bank, open an issue with **Remove bank** template.

If you wish, fork this repository, make changes to all files (csv, json, markdown, sql, xml) and change readme files with a changelog (stating their name and issue code).
